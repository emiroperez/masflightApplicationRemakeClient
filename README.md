# MasflightApplicationRemakeClient

This is a remake for the masFlight client web application, now part of Pulse.

Pulse is a set of web applications intended to be used for checking flight-related information. There are five applications which are the following:

- Connectivity
- Maritime
- Content Analytics
- masFlight
- DataLake

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --aot --output-hashing=all --build-optimizer=false` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
